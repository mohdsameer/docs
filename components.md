## Task Processing Components

Task Processing Components are the building blocks to allow you to get information back from users when they process your tasks.

### Text Area

Example:
```javascript
{
  "component_type": "text_area",
  "label": "Tell us how you are feeling?",
  "name": "my_feelings",
  "extra": {
    "instructions": "",
    "character_limit": 140
}
```
